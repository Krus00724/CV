            <p>Hi there,</p>
            <p>I am Krzysztof Wiatr, a media creator and photographer driven by a passion for capturing real, intimate moments with the people closest to me. My work centers around friends and the personal milestones that shape our lives—these are the moments I find truly beautiful and meaningful.
<br>
                Originally, I studied biology, but my heart was always set on something more expressive and visual. I made the leap to pursue a creative path, one that lets me capture the essence of individuals and the raw energy of scenes around me.
                <br>
                Living in Berlin, I am deeply connected to the city’s vibrant party scene, where I’ve also worked and built many close relationships. This experience has shaped my unique perspective, allowing me to approach my work with an open, friendly attitude that puts my subjects at ease. I bring a special, intimate approach to each person I photograph, aiming to reveal their true essence in a way that feels authentic and warm.
                <br>
                Thank you for visiting my portfolio—I hope these images speak to you as much as the moments spoke to me.
